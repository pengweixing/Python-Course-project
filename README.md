## Project

I am working on 2-D cell image visulization. For a given animal tissue, we could detect the target gene signal for each cell. After detection, we could get a matrix data, but there are lots of NA values since not all cells are detectable and the tissue are usually in irregular shape. It is very important to provide a tool to visualize the cell-signal matrix data.  

My goals are:

- Implement this task by using Matplolib
- Avoid using imshow and other heatmap function
- Provide user-friendly API to make it easy to call by other people
- Make the code elegant and provide readable annotation
